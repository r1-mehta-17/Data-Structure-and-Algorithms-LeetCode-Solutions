# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-LeetCode-Solutions
This contains the solutions to the very popular LeetCode problems on data structures and arrays.
Some solutions are in Python language and some are in C++. I have learnt Data Structures and Algorithms using C, C++ and Python. So accordingly the solutions are in the language that makes the solution more and more easier.
